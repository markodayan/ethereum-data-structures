# About The Project

This repository was made to provide various utilities for interacting with Ethereum along with implementation of methods
highlighting crucial tasks conducted by in the permissionless environment inherent with blockchain networks (such as
producing and verifying Merkle proofs).

The goal of this repository is to educate developers about how various aspects of Ethereum (and blockchain protocols in
general) work and to provide some useful tools to make your developer experience less frustrating with interacting with
Ethereum or learning how certain complicated aspects of the protocol work.
