# Ethereum Core + Data Structures

A informal documentation of Ethereum core.

Go to a directory and you will find a markdown file and maybe some code depending on the topic. My goal is to demystify the complexity of Ethereum (for myself at least).

## Topics (so far)

- [Recursive Length Prefix (RLP)](https://github.com/markodayan/ethereum-data-structures/tree/master/RLP)
- [Ethereum JSON-RPC API Specification](https://github.com/markodayan/ethereum-data-structures/tree/master/json-rpc)
